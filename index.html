        <p>Fern Street Settlement founded in 1907, owes its existence to a remarkable woman, Clara Ellen Grant OBE, who dedicated her life to bettering the conditions of children and families in the East End of London. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Born in Frome, Somerset Clara arrived in Wapping as a young teacher in 1894, taking on the role of headteacher of Devons Road Infant School in 1900 (now Clara Grant Primary School). Compelled by her Christian faith to address the poverty
          and deprivation blighting the lives of her young pupils she founded Fern Street Settlement in 1907 to serve as a hub to improve the health, education and living conditions of families in Bromley-on-Bow. These included regular medical,
          dental and maternity clinics, a nursery school, ‘thrift club’, distribution of clothes, shoes and baby equipment and perhaps most famously, the weekly Farthing Bundle ceremony. </p>

        <div class="p1">
          <p>
            It was the weekly distribution of these small packages of toys that earned Clara Grant the nickname “<em>The Bundle Woman of Bow</em>”.
            <br>
            <br>
            These bundles proved so popular that in 1913 Clara was forced to adopt a
            height restriction – only those children who could walk under her small wooden arch inscribed
            <br> <strong>“Enter all ye children small – none can come that are too tall”</strong>
            were able to receive, although we doubt she stuck to the rules.

        <p>
          The much-loved Farthing Bundle ceremony continued long beyond Clara’s death in 1949 and was still going as late as 1984.
          <br>

          However, as slum clearance moved young families out of London, a crisis of poverty and isolation among the aging East Enders left behind shifted the focus of the work of the Settlement. <br> <br>

          The nature of the East End is always to change and evolve with the shifting demographics of its community.  So, after a period of attending to the needs of the elderly the work of Fern Street Settlement returned to being more family focused.  Undoubtedly, the object of The Settlement and Means of Achievement still stay core to the work that is done today.

        <p>In 2014 Fern Street Settlement relaunched its work with children and families in partnership with
          <a href="https://www.allhallowsbow.org.uk/">All Hallows Bow Church</a> and in 2019 the  joint project took the name of The Fern Street Family Centre.
